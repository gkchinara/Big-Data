-->Identify relevant variables
-->Choose right visualization
-->Explore relations
-->Generate insights

Data automatically diided into two catagories--
---------------------------------------------
-->Dimensions (Catagorical)
-->Measures(To perform numerical operations)

Creating interactive dahsboards using Tablue-
---------------------------------------------

-->Dash board is collection of views stored on a single sheet where we can compair or moniter varity of data view symoltaniously.
-->Tableau Dashboards are excellent for analyzing informations and monitering performance on overall business goals

Tablue Hadoop Integration
--------------------------

Tableau enables connectivity to various Hadoop distributionand provides adhoc visualization capabilities on Hadoop data

-->Extend usablity of Apache hadoop through Tableau

-->Use Apache Hive as defacto standard for sql access in Hadoop
-->Works with Cloudera, HortonWorks and MapR version via ODBC
-->Connects to Hadoop Hive through hive server or hiveserver2
-->Processing is done wih help of In-memory analytical engine
-->Offers XML processing functionality for Hadoop data

-->Tablue supports connection to data stored in cloudera's, hortonworks' and MapR's distributions via ODBC connection
Prerequisites
	-->Setting up of functioning Hadoop cluster
	-->Respective ODBC driver installation
Connect to Hadoop hive
	-->Possible with both hiveserver or hiveserver2
	-->Version of driver should be compatible with Hadoop distribution

Starting hive services
